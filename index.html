                break in to any house and re-decorate it. It didn't matter who was living there. One time I broke in to
                the Batcave and made it look like Hello Kitty was living there!"<br>
                "It was a lucky coincidence that was able to make a career out of it. Someone had heard about me and
                asked if I
                wanted to re-decorate their lair! First I was against it, but then I was offered a lot of money and said
                yes!"
