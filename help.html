        <div class="faq">
            <p class="question">Who owns the company?</p>
            <p>The founder of the company wants to remain anonymous, but used to go around as "The
                Prettifier". The Prettifier has a long history of decorating houses. At first they used to do it
                without permission. "I was quite a rascal in my youth, and was often called chaotic neutral. I used to
                break in to any house and re-decorate it. It didn't matter who was living there. One time I broke in to
                the Batcave and made it look like Hello Kitty was living there!"<br>
                "It was a lucky coincidence that was able to make a career out of it. Someone had heard about me and
                asked if I
                wanted to re-decorate their lair! First I was against it, but then I was offered a lot of money and said
                yes!"
