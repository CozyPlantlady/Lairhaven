#Lairhaven

Goals:

To make a website for hideout leasing service

Design point: mobile-first

What it needs:

Function:
As a customer, I need to be able to easily see what website offers

As a customer, I need to be able to contact the company

As a customer, I want to know more about the company

As a customer, I want to know what others think about the company

As a customer, I need the company to be reachable


What is their goal? What problem does this product or feature solve for them?
User needs to find a safe lair. Its a bonus that this company does the styling and moving for them too, 
since it safes time. Also their name canÂ´t be then found from public record, since company keeps it hidden. 	
This allows them to live in other locations than on abandoned building sites --> comfort and security
		

What are some of the actions or operations they are likely to perform?
Customer meetup (online) to make the contract and if needed on location, decoration/styling of location, Moving in (secretly, with ninjas),
Customer care (24/7, because evil never sleeps), 
Official minions and sidekicks have a chance to rent an underling apartment (aka student apartment).

The company saw a need for secure lairs. This company os neutral, and wont be taking part of any turf wars.
This company leases great locations, that are safe and hidden even if they are in the middle of a city,
but also looks for other locations like abandoned bunkers, caves, abandoned fairgrounds, castles, 
abandoned factories and so on, since some customers prefer it that way.. 
As a bonus this company does the hideout decoration to match the customers brand.
