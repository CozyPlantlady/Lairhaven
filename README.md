# Lairhaven - website for hideout leasing service

Lairhaven provides hideouts and headquarters for superheroes and villains. This company os neutral, and wont be taking part of any turf wars.
This company leases great locations that are safe and hidden even if they are in the middle of a city,
but also looks for other locations like abandoned bunkers, caves, abandoned fairgrounds, castles,
